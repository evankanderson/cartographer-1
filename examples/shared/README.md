# Shared

In this directory you'll find Kubernetes objects that are common between the examples.
These are split into two groups:
- cluster objects that prepare a cluster to work with Cartographer and the controllers
  referenced in the template
- templates which are referenced by the supply chains

All of the objects in these folders would be deployed by operations teams. Developers
need not be aware of them.
